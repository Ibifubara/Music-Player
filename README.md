# Music-Player - A code along from Brad Traversy's youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTHRWGn_sJw

## Overview
- The task was to build a mini music player and use javscript to make it functional
- Make the previous, next, and play/pause work as they should
- Be able to see a progress bar as the song plays
- Be able to click on the progress bar and skip the song
- Get the music Cover spinning and the music title displayed for each song played

## Challenges
- I realised that the music container wasn't accepting the classList I added
- It made me make my reseach by the use of google to check why and I found out I called it by Id instead of class. It wasn't working because the Id wasn't recognized

## Take out:
- I was able to learn new event listeners and overall new concepts in JavaScript

## Future Study:
- I hope to keep learning and improving on previous knowledge In JavaScript
- Learn about methods, events in Javascript as well
